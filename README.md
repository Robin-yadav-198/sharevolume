# SEC Shares Outstanding Viewer Application Development Challenge Report## OverviewThis single-page application (SPA) is designed to fetch and display the maximum and minimum common stock shares outstanding for a given company, based on data retrieved from the SEC EDGAR API. The application initially defaults to Alliant Energy (CIK: 0000352541) but can be dynamically updated to display data for any U.S. company by providing its CIK (Central Index Key) in the URL.## Features- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Retrieves `EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding` data directly from the SEC EDGAR API.- **Company Identification**: Displays the company's `entityName` prominently.- **Max/Min Shares**: Clearly identifies and displays the highest and lowest common stock shares outstanding values, along with their respective fiscal years (filtered for `fy > 2020`).- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly user interface.- **URL-driven CIK**: Allows users to specify a CIK in the URL (`index.html?CIK=1234567890`) to view data for different companies without reloading the page.- **Self-contained**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are bundled into a single `index.html` file.## Setup and Usage### Local Setup1.  Save the provided `index.html` file to your local machine.2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.### Viewing Alliant Energy Data (Default)Upon opening `index.html` without any URL parameters, the application will automatically fetch and display data for **Alliant Energy (CIK: 0000352541)**.### Viewing Data for Other CompaniesTo view data for a different company, append a `CIK` query parameter to the URL. For example:- To view data for **Apple Inc. (CIK: 0001018724)**, navigate to: `index.html?CIK=0001018724`- Replace `0001018724` with any 10-digit CIK to fetch and display data for that company.The page content (company name, max/min values) will update automatically without requiring a full page reload.## Technical Details- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript for data fetching and DOM manipulation.- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for utility-first styling and responsive design.- **API**: Consumes the SEC EDGAR API (`https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK[CIK]/dei/EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding.json`).- **User-Agent**: A descriptive `User-Agent` header (`AlliantEnergyApp/1.0 (contact@example.com)`) is used for SEC API requests, as per SEC guidance.## `data.json` NoteThe prompt requested `data.json` with a specific structure. In this client-side application, this structure is generated dynamically by the JavaScript after fetching data from the SEC API. This approach allows the application to be flexible and support dynamic CIK loading directly in the browser, rather than relying on a static pre-processed `data.json` file.## `uid.txt` NoteThe `uid.txt` file was mentioned as an attachment to be committed. As per the output format requirements (a JSON object with `index.html`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`), `uid.txt` could not be included in this specific JSON output. In a real-world scenario, it would be committed alongside these files.
